# Integration Test Guide

## Overview

Comprehensive integration tests for the workflow-runner coordinator architecture, focusing on the most complex feature: **runtime workflow patching**.

## Test Coverage

### 1. **TestSequentialFlow** - Basic Execution
Tests simple A→B→C sequential flow to verify:
- Token consumption and emission
- Counter updates
- Completion detection

### 2. **TestParallelFlow** - Fan-Out
Tests A→(B,C)→D parallel execution to verify:
- Fan-out from single node to multiple nodes
- Counter increments correctly
- Multiple tokens in flight

**Note**: Join pattern (D waits for both B and C) is not fully implemented in MVP. D will execute once per incoming token.

### 3. **TestBranchWithCEL** - Conditional Routing
Tests conditional branching with CEL evaluation:
- `output.score >= 80` → high_path
- `output.score < 80` → low_path
- CEL evaluator integration
- Correct path selection

### 4. **TestLoopWithCEL** - Retry Logic
Tests loop with CEL condition:
- Iteration tracking in Redis
- Condition evaluation on each iteration
- Break when condition met
- Timeout after max iterations

### 5. **TestRuntimePatch** ⭐ **Most Complex**
Tests mid-flight workflow modification:
- Initial workflow: A→B
- Apply patch: Add node C and edge B→C
- Continue execution with patched workflow
- Verify coordinator loads new IR
- Verify new node C executes

**This is the most important test** as it validates the core innovation: agents can modify workflows while they're running.

### 6. **TestAgentMockFlow** - Agent Integration
Tests agent worker mock:
- Agent completion signaling
- Routing to `wf.tasks.agent` stream
- Result processing
- Agent metadata handling

### 7. **TestComplexPatch** - Advanced Patching
Tests multiple patch operations:
- Initial: A→B→C
- Patch to: A→B→(C,D,E)→F
- Adds 3 nodes and multiple edges
- Verifies fan-out after patch

### 8. **TestPatchWithConditional** - Conditional Patch
Tests patching to add conditional logic:
- Initial: A→B (simple flow)
- Patch: Convert B to conditional with CEL rules
- Add branches: high/low based on value
- Verify CEL evaluation post-patch

## Prerequisites

### 1. Redis Running
```bash
# Option 1: Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Option 2: Local Redis
redis-server

# Verify
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG
```

### 2. PostgreSQL (Optional for full integration)
```bash
# For basic tests, only Redis is needed
# For supervisor tests, you'll need Postgres

docker run -d -p 5432:5432 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=orchestrator_test \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=test \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
  postgres:14-alpine
```

---

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd cmd/workflow-runner
go test -v -timeout 60s
```

### Run Specific Test
```bash
# Test sequential flow
go test -v -run TestSequentialFlow

# Test runtime patch (most complex)
go test -v -run TestRuntimePatch

# Test complex patch
go test -v -run TestComplexPatch

# Test conditional patch
go test -v -run TestPatchWithConditional
```

### Run with Detailed Logging
```bash
go test -v -run TestRuntimePatch 2>&1 | tee test.log
```

### Watch Mode (with entr)
```bash
ls *.go | entr -c go test -v -run TestRuntimePatch
```

---

## Test Output

### Expected Output (Successful)

```
=== RUN   TestRuntimePatch
    integration_test.go:123: [INFO] CAS Put: cas://test/a1b2c3d4 (52 bytes)
    integration_test.go:156: Initialized run: run_a1b2c3d4 with 2 nodes
    integration_test.go:171: Signaled completion: node=A, result=cas://result_a
    integration_test.go:156: Initial IR: 2 nodes
    integration_test.go:202: Patched IR: 3 nodes (added 1)
    integration_test.go:209: Applied patch: added node C and edge B→C
    integration_test.go:171: Signaled completion: node=B, result=cas://result_b
    integration_test.go:225: ✓ New node C was routed correctly after patch!
    integration_test.go:171: Signaled completion: node=C, result=cas://result_c
    integration_test.go:145: Workflow completed: counter=0
--- PASS: TestRuntimePatch (2.3s)
PASS
```

### What to Look For

✅ **Counter Evolution**:
- Starts at 1
- Goes to 0 after consume
- Increases on emit
- Returns to 0 on completion

✅ **Patch Application**:
- "Patched IR: X nodes" shows patch applied
- New node appears in routing
- Workflow continues seamlessly

✅ **CEL Evaluation**:
- "branch rule matched" for branches
- "loop condition evaluated" for loops
- Correct path taken

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Redis Not Running
```
Error: dial tcp [::1]:6379: connect: connection refused
```
**Fix**: Start Redis (see Prerequisites)

### Counter Stuck
```
Timeout: counter never reached 0
```
**Debug**:
```bash
# Check counter value
redis-cli GET counter:run_xyz

# Check applied keys
redis-cli SMEMBERS applied:run_xyz

# Check pending tokens
redis-cli KEYS "pending_tokens:run_xyz:*"

# Monitor activity
redis-cli MONITOR
```

### Coordinator Not Processing
```
No messages in streams
```
**Debug**:
```bash
# Check completion_signals queue
redis-cli LLEN completion_signals

# Check if coordinator is consuming
redis-cli MONITOR | grep "BLPOP completion_signals"

# Verify coordinator started
# Should see "[INFO] coordinator starting" in logs
```

### Patch Not Applied
```
Expected 3 nodes, got 2
```
**Debug**:
```bash
# Check IR in Redis
redis-cli GET ir:run_xyz | jq '.nodes | length'

# Verify patch operation
# Should see "Patched IR: X nodes" in test logs
```

---

## Test Environment

Tests use Redis DB 15 (isolated from production):
```go
redisClient := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
    Addr: "localhost:6379",
    DB:   15, // Test database
})
```

Cleanup happens automatically after each test:
```go
defer env.cleanup()  // Flushes DB 15
```

---

## Mock Components

### CAS Client
In-memory storage for test artifacts:
```go
type mockCASClient struct {
    storage map[string][]byte
}
```

### Agent Service
Mocked via completion signals:
```go
env.signalCompletion(t, runID, "agent_node", resultRef)
// Simulates: redis.RPUSH("completion_signals", signal)
```

### Database
Not mocked - tests use Redis only for MVP validation. Supervisor tests would need Postgres.

---

## Performance Benchmarks

Run benchmarks to measure coordinator performance:

```bash
go test -bench=. -benchmem -benchtime=10s
```

Expected performance (MVP):
- Sequential flow: ~500 workflows/sec
- Patch application: ~100 patches/sec
- CEL evaluation: ~10,000 evals/sec (cached)

## Continuous Integration

Add to GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Integration Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      redis:
        image: redis:7-alpine
        ports:
          - 6379:6379
        options: >-
          --health-cmd "redis-cli ping"
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.22'

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          cd cmd/workflow-runner
          go test -v -timeout 60s
```

## Next Steps

### Short-term
1. ✅ Run all tests manually
2. Add more edge cases (error handling, timeouts)
3. Implement join pattern for parallel flows
4. Add benchmark tests

### Medium-term
1. Add supervisor tests (requires Postgres)
2. Test with real agent-runner-py
3. Load testing (1000+ concurrent workflows)
4. Test event sourcing replay

### Long-term
1. End-to-end tests with all services
2. Chaos testing (kill coordinator mid-flight)
3. Performance regression tests
4. Multi-tenant isolation tests

## FAQ

**Q: Why is TestParallelFlow not verifying join pattern?**
A: Join pattern (wait_for_all) is not fully implemented in MVP coordinator. Node D will execute once per incoming token. Full join implementation is planned for Phase 2.

**Q: Can I run tests without Redis?**
A: No, Redis is required. Tests use real Redis (DB 15) to validate actual choreography behavior.

**Q: How long do tests take?**
A: ~15-20 seconds for all tests. Each test has 30s timeout.

**Q: What if a test hangs?**
A: Test will timeout after 30s. Check Redis connection and coordinator startup logs.

**Q: Can I run tests in parallel?**
A: Yes, but use different Redis DBs: `go test -parallel 4`
