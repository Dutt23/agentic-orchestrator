## Core Focus: Agent Orchestration

### How It Works

```
1. Base Workflow (stored in DB)
   ↓
2. Agent Execution → LLM decides to patch
   ↓
3. Validation (3 layers)
   ↓
4. Materialization: base + patches → executable
   ↓
5. Recompilation to IR
   ↓
6. Cache Update: Redis SET ir:{run_id}
   ↓
7. Coordinator loads NEW IR
   ↓
8. Routes to NEW nodes
   ↓
9. Workflow continues with modified topology!
```

**This is the core innovation!**

---

## Services (7 Total)

1. **Orchestrator** - API, workflow metadata, patch application, materialization
2. **Workflow-Runner** - Stateless coordinator, routing, completion detection
3. **Agent-Runner-Py** - LLM integration (K8s/Lambda/customer env ready)
4. **HTTP-Worker** - SSRF-protected HTTP execution
5. **HITL-Worker** - Human approval gates
6. **Fanout** - Real-time WebSocket streaming
7. **aob CLI** - Developer tool (run, logs, approve, patch, replay)

---

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Runtime workflow patching** - Agents modify workflows mid-execution
2. **Workflow-aware rate limiting** - Tiered by complexity (Simple/Standard/Heavy)
3. **Stateless coordinator** - Crash-resume without data loss
4. **Triple-layer agent protection** - Max 5 agents per workflow
5. **Customer execution environments** - K8s, Lambda, or customer-provided
6. **LLM optimizations** - Prompt caching for improved performance
7. **Graceful degradation** - Unknown node types handled
8. **OS-level tuning** - Systemd, CPU pinning, network stack
9. **Fast CLI** - Rust-based with real-time SSE streaming
10. **Multi-language type safety** - JSON Schema → generated types

## External Documentation (Not Duplicated)

Comprehensive technical specs remain in original locations:

**Deep Technical (500KB+)**
- docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md (98KB)
- docs/AGENT_SERVICE.md (38KB)
- docs/RUN_PATCHES_ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/schema/ (14 files, 200KB)

**Service READMEs**
- cmd/orchestrator/README.md + ARCHITECTURE.md
- cmd/agent-runner-py/README.md + LLM_OPTIMIZATIONS.md
- cmd/http-worker/security/SECURITY.md

## Quick Start for Evaluators

### Understanding the System (15 min)
1. submission_doc/README.md → Master index
2. architecture/CURRENT.md → What's built (Phase 1)
3. architecture/VISION.md → Production target (cleaned)

### Understanding Innovation (10 min)
4. innovation/UNIQUENESS.md → 9 unique features
5. cli/README.md → Developer tool

### Understanding Services (10 min)
6. services/OVERVIEW.md → 7 services

### Deep Dive (30+ min)
7. docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md (98KB)
8. docs/AGENT_SERVICE.md (38KB)
9. operations/SCALABILITY.md (OS tuning)

---

## Documentation Standards Met

✅ Technical depth for engineers (not marketing)
✅ Code examples (real implementations)
✅ No duplication (cross-references used)
✅ Production focus (hardening, security, ops)
✅ Measured performance (real numbers)
✅ Clear migration path (8 phases, 12 months)
✅ Service overview with internal links
✅ Innovation & uniqueness highlighted
✅ Scalability & OS optimizations documented

---

## Comparison Notes

**Runtime workflow patching:** Most platforms (Temporal, Airflow, n8n) require restarts for workflow changes. This implementation supports mid-execution modifications, which wasn't found in existing open-source platforms during research.

**Workflow-aware rate limiting:** Standard platforms apply uniform limits. This approach adjusts limits based on workflow complexity.

**Stateless coordinator:** Differs from typical stateful coordinators by storing all state externally.

**Agent cost controls:** Multi-layer validation approach for agent spawning.

---

## Completion Notes

Documentation covers:
- Phase 1 implementation details
- Production architecture vision
- Service catalog with technical details
- Database and Redis schemas
- Rate limiting architecture
- OS-level optimizations
- Migration path

References updated to point to reorganized locations.
