## Core Innovation: Agent Orchestration

### How It Works

```
1. Base Workflow (v1.0)
   Stored in database as artifact

2. Agent Patch Generated
   LLM: "Add email notification"
   â†’ JSON Patch: {op: "add", path: "/nodes/-", value: {email_node}}

3. Validation (3 Layers)
   Python: Syntax check + agent spawn limit
   Go: Schema validation against node registry
   Coordinator: Security check during routing

4. Materialization
   Base Workflow (v1.0)
     + Agent Patch 1
     = Materialized Workflow (v1.1)

5. IR Recompilation
   Materialized Workflow â†’ IR Compiler â†’ Intermediate Representation
   â†’ Cache: Redis SET ir:{run_id} {new_ir}

6. Coordinator Reloads
   On next completion signal:
   ir := loadIR(runID)  // Gets NEW version!
   nextNodes := determineNextNodes(ir, ...)
   // Routes to NEW nodes from patched IR!

7. Execution Continues
   Workflow runs with modified topology
   New nodes execute seamlessly
```

**This is the core: safe runtime workflow modification!**
