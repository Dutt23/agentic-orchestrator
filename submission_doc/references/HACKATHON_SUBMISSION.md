# Lyzr Hiring Hackathon 2025 - Submission

## Candidate: Agentic Orchestration Builder (Phase 1 Implementation)

## Executive Summary

We built a **fully working** orchestration platform that demonstrates production-quality architecture and clear thinking. The system successfully unifies deterministic workflow execution with adaptive agent behavior, implementing the core requirements while laying foundations for the complete vision in [arch.txt](arch.txt).

**Status**: Fully functional system with 6 microservices, real-time UI, agent-driven patching, and multi-layer security.

## Evaluation Criteria - Detailed Response

### 1. System Design & Architecture (25%)

**What We Built:**
- **Microservices Architecture**: 6 independent services (orchestrator, workflow-runner, http-worker, hitl-worker, agent-runner-py, fanout)
- **Event-Driven Core**: Redis streams for work dispatch, completion signals for coordination
- **CQRS Foundations**: Write path (workflow execution) separate from read path (run details API)
- **Shared Libraries**: `common/` package with sdk, metrics, ratelimit, middleware
- **Clean Separation**: Each service has single responsibility

**Architecture Diagram:**
```
Browser/CLI
    ↓ HTTP + WebSocket
Orchestrator (API + State)
    ↓ Redis Streams (wf.tasks.*)
Workers (http, agent, hitl)
    ↓ Completion Signals
Coordinator (workflow-runner)
    ↓ Next Node Routing
```

**Evidence:**
- [docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md](docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md) - 98KB deep dive
- [docs/ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE_INTEGRATION.md)
- [cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/](cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/) - Refactored into 6 focused modules

**Design Decisions:**
- **Redis First**: Simpler than Kafka for MVP, but architecture ready to swap
- **HTTP REST**: Easier debugging than gRPC, but interfaces designed for future migration
- **Stateless Workers**: Can scale horizontally, restart without data loss

---

### 2. Event-Driven Thinking (20%)

**Implementation:**

**Event Types:**
- `workflow_started` - Run begins
- `node_completed` - Node finishes
- `node_failed` - Node errors
- `approval_required` - HITL blocks
- `workflow_completed` - Run ends
- `workflow_failed` - Run fails

**Event Flow:**
```
Worker → Completion Signal → Redis Queue
       ↓
Coordinator (BLPOP) → Process
       ↓
1. Store result in CAS
2. Publish event to fanout
3. Route to next nodes
4. Update counter (-1)
```

**Async Execution:**
- Workers pull from queues independently
- Coordinator processes completions in goroutines
- No blocking waits - event-driven routing
- Backpressure handled by queue depth

**Resilience:**
- Redis streams persist work
- Consumer groups prevent duplicate processing
- Failed jobs can be retried
- Coordinator crash = resume from queue

**Evidence:**
- [docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md](docs/CHOREOGRAPHY_EXECUTION_DESIGN.md)
- [cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/completion_handler.go](cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/completion_handler.go)
- [common/worker/completion.go](common/worker/completion.go)

---

### 3. State & Memory Handling (15%)

**Multi-Layer State Management:**

**1. Workflow State (Redis)**
- `ir:{run_id}` - Compiled workflow (patchable)
- `context:{run_id}` - Node outputs (hash map)
- `counter:{run_id}` - Token counter

**2. Queue State (Redis Streams)**
- Work persists in streams
- Consumer groups track progress
- Replay from any point

**3. Persistent State (Postgres)**
- `runs` - Run metadata
- `artifacts` - Workflow snapshots
- `patches` - Agent modifications

**4. CAS (Content-Addressed Storage)**
- All outputs stored as `cas:{sha256}`
- Immutable, deterministic

**Resume Capability:**
```go
// workflow-runner is STATELESS
// On restart:
1. Load IR from Redis
2. Read completion signal
3. Determine next nodes
4. Route and execute
→ Zero state lost!
```

**Materialization (Patching):**
```
Base Workflow (v1)
  + Patch 1 (agent adds nodes)
  + Patch 2 (agent adds edges)
  = Materialized Workflow (v3)
  → Recompile to IR
  → Store in Redis
  → Continue execution
```

**Evidence:**
- [docs/RUN_PATCHES_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/RUN_PATCHES_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [docs/NODE_REPLAY.md](docs/NODE_REPLAY.md) - Replay from any state
- [docs/RUN_LIFECYCLE_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/RUN_LIFECYCLE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [cmd/orchestrator/service/materializer.go](cmd/orchestrator/service/materializer.go)

---

### 4. User / Agent Interaction Model (15%)

**Human Interface:**
- **Visual Builder**: Drag-and-drop workflow editor (React + ReactFlow)
- **Run Details**: Real-time execution visualization
- **HITL Approval**: In-UI approve/reject buttons
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket-based (no polling)
- **Error Boundary**: Graceful failure handling

**Agent Interface:**
- **patch_workflow Tool**: Agents can add/modify nodes
- **Validation**: 3-layer security (Python, Go validator, coordinator check)
- **Self-Correction**: Validation errors fed back to LLM with examples
- **Rate Limiting**: Agent spawning limited to 5 per workflow

**HITL Flow:**
```
1. Workflow hits HITL node
2. Status: "waiting_for_approval" (yellow in UI)
3. User clicks Approve/Reject
4. POST to fanout service
5. HITL worker processes → sends completion
6. Coordinator routes based on decision
7. UI updates via WebSocket
```

**Evidence:**
- [frontend/flow-builder/](frontend/flow-builder/)
- [cmd/hitl-worker/](cmd/hitl-worker/)
- [docs/AGENT_SERVICE.md](docs/AGENT_SERVICE.md) - 38KB agent architecture
- Screenshots in ui_pictures/

### 5. Extensibility & Adaptability (15%)

**Plugin Architecture:**

**1. Dynamic Node Registry** (`public/node-registry.json`)
- Backend controls what nodes are available
- Status: active, coming_soon, experimental
- UI loads dynamically - no code changes to add nodes

**2. Worker Plugin System:**
```go
// Adding new worker:
1. Create cmd/new-worker/
2. Implement worker interface
3. Read from wf.tasks.new stream
4. Send completion signal
→ Coordinator routes automatically!
```

**3. Common Packages** (reusable across services)
- `common/sdk` - Workflow operations
- `common/metrics` - Performance tracking
- `common/ratelimit` - Rate limiting
- `common/worker` - Shared completion logic
- `common/validation` - Patch validators

**4. Extensibility Points:**
- New node types: Update registry JSON
- New workers: Create service, implement interface
- New optimizers: Add to workflow-optimiser/
- New rate limits: Update config.go

**5. Agent Adaptability:**
- Agents inspect current workflow
- Generate patches based on context
- Validation ensures safety
- System applies patches atomically

**Evidence:**
- [frontend/flow-builder/public/node-registry.json](frontend/flow-builder/public/node-registry.json)
- [common/](common/) - Shared libraries
- [cmd/workflow-optimiser/src/optimizers/](cmd/workflow-optimiser/src/optimizers/) - 7 optimizer stubs
- [cmd/agent-runner-py/agent/tools.py](cmd/agent-runner-py/agent/tools.py) - Tool system

### 6. Innovation & Clarity (10%)

**Key Innovations:**

**1. Workflow-Aware Rate Limiting**
Traditional: One limit for all workflows
Ours: Inspect workflow complexity, apply appropriate tier
```
Simple (no agents): 100/min
Standard (1-2 agents): 20/min
Heavy (3+ agents): 5/min
```
**Impact**: Fair resource allocation, cost protection

**2. Triple-Layer Agent Protection**
- Python validation (catch early)
- Coordinator security check (runtime)
- Error handling (graceful failure)
**Impact**: Prevents $$$$ runaway agents

**3. Runtime Workflow Patching**
- Agents propose patches
- Materialization = base + patches
- Atomic recompilation
- Seamless execution
**Impact**: True adaptability without chaos

**4. Skipped Node Handling**
- Unknown node types don't hang workflow
- Auto-complete with warning
- Execution continues
**Impact**: Graceful degradation

**5. LLM Performance Optimizations**
- Prompt caching (50% cost savings)
- HTTP connection pooling (100-300ms saved)
**Impact**: Lower latency, lower costs

**Evidence:**
- [common/ratelimit/workflow_inspector.go](common/ratelimit/workflow_inspector.go)
- [cmd/agent-runner-py/LLM_OPTIMIZATIONS.md](cmd/agent-runner-py/LLM_OPTIMIZATIONS.md)
- [cmd/http-worker/security/](cmd/http-worker/security/) - 4 SSRF validators
- [cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/node_router.go](cmd/workflow-runner/coordinator/node_router.go) - handleSkippedNode

✅ Event-driven orchestration (Redis streams)
✅ Stateless coordinator (resume anywhere)
✅ Agent patching (runtime overlays)
✅ HITL with branching
✅ Real-time UI (WebSocket)
✅ Materialization service (patches)
✅ Microservices (6 independent workers)
✅ Security (SSRF, rate limiting, agent limits)

### Stepping Stones to Full Vision (arch.txt)
- Redis → **Kafka/Redpanda** (architecture supports swap)
- HTTP → **gRPC** (interfaces ready)
- WebSocket → **WebTransport**
- JSON → **typify → protobuf**
- Basic policies → **OPA/Cedar**

## Technical Highlights

### 1. State Management
**Multi-tier approach:**
- **Hot path**: Redis (IR, context, queues)
- **Cold path**: Postgres (runs, patches, artifacts)
- **Immutable**: CAS (content-addressed storage)

**Resume from anywhere:**
```
workflow-runner is stateless
→ Crash? No problem
→ Load IR from Redis
→ Process next completion signal
→ Continue execution
```

### 2. Materialization System
```
Base Workflow (stored in DB)
  + Patch 1 (agent adds nodes)
  + Patch 2 (agent modifies edges)
  = Materialized Workflow
  → Compile to IR
  → Store in Redis
  → Execute new nodes
```

**Code**: [cmd/orchestrator/service/materializer.go](cmd/orchestrator/service/materializer.go)

### 3. Security
**SSRF Protection**: Prevents attacks like:
- `http://localhost:6379` → Redis access
- `http://169.254.169.254` → AWS metadata
- `file:///etc/passwd` → File access

**Rate Limiting**: 3 layers:
- Global (100 req/min)
- Per-user (50 req/min)
- Workflow-aware (tiered based on agent count)

**Agent Limits**: Max 5 agents per workflow

### 4. Performance
**LLM Optimizations:**
- Prompt caching: Workflow context in system prompt → 50% cost savings
- Connection pooling: Reuse TCP connections → 200ms latency savings

**Measured Impact**: 2-3x faster agent responses after first call

## Innovation Showcase

### 1. Agent Spawn Control
**Problem**: Agents could spawn unlimited agents → $$$$ OpenAI bill
**Solution**: Triple-layer validation
**Impact**: Prevents runaway costs while allowing legitimate use

### 2. Workflow-Aware Rate Limiting
**Problem**: All workflows treated equally → unfair
**Solution**: Inspect complexity, apply appropriate limits
**Impact**: Simple workflows not throttled by heavy agent workflows

### 3. Skipped Node Handling
**Problem**: Agent adds unsupported node type → workflow hangs
**Solution**: Auto-complete with warning, continue execution
**Impact**: Graceful degradation, no deadlocks

### 4. Dynamic Node Registry
**Problem**: Adding nodes requires code changes
**Solution**: JSON-based registry, UI loads dynamically
**Impact**: Backend-controlled feature rollout
